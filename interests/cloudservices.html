    	<div class="section" id="section1"><strong><h1>What are cloud services?</h1>A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider</strong> </div>
    	
    	
	    <div class="section" id="section2"><strong><H1>Why am I interested in Cloud Services?</H1>Cloud computing offers any business many benefits. It allows you to set up what is essentially a virtual office to give you the flexibility of connecting to your business anywhere, any time. With the growing number of web-enabled devices used in today's business environment (e.g. smartphones, tablets), access to your data is even easier.It's obivous to me that cloud technology is an exciting and an essential upcoming technology that will revolutionise the ways that business' operate online.  </strong></div>
	    <div class="section" id="section3"><strong><H1>What are the benefits of Cloud Services?</H1>The main benefit of cloud computing is that it leads to a significant reduction in costs. This reduction is from a decrease in operating and maintenance costs. You only pay for capacity when you need it.Another benefit is the accessibility of the cloud. As long as you have an internet connection you can access your data from anywhere.

When on the cloud, employees, partners and clients can access and update information from any location. Those updates with software or platforms are automatic, or in real-time. Having the ability to access information and others so easily and quickly increases functionality and helps foster innovation.

A significant advantage of cloud computing is the ease of updating the software. Cloud computing allows for frequent, undisruptive software updates. This ensures you have the best features of the software without interrupting your work time. Updates donâ€™t require a lengthy installation of new software.

These are what I consider the major advantages of Cloud Services, but these are only my opinion, and there are many more advantages then those listed above.</strong></div>
